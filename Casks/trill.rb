  # Trill is signed with our Developer ID and notarized by Apple (nebelhaus/trill,
  # release.yml), so Gatekeeper clears it on first launch — no quarantine hack.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The live Messages provider reads ~/Library/Messages/chat.db (always
    read-only) and needs Full Disk Access. Grant it once in System Settings ->
    Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access (add Trill). Fixture mode needs
    no permissions at all.
